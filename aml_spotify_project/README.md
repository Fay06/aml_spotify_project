# aml_spotify_project

Project for course COMS 4995 W22 - AML

### Due Dates:
- Project proposal: 2/23/23
- Data analysis and visualization: 3/30/23
- Report & Code: 4/27/23

### work for deliverable 3:
- training supervised learning models (SVM, logsitic regression, gradient-boosted trees, RF, NN)
- tuning models (feature engineering, hyperparam tuning)
- model analysis (feature importance/permutation impotance/lime/shap)

- Albert: clustering songs with PCA / TSNE, neural nets 
- Eric: SVM, logistic regression
- Yufei: tree models (GB, RF)

outputs for report: 
- accuracy metrics of all the models on same plot
- clustering visualization
- model summaries
- feature importance plots
